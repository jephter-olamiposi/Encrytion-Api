# Secure Encryption API

  Secure Encryption API is a high-performance, production-ready RESTful service for securely encrypting and decrypting messages. Built with Rust and powered by AES-256-GCM, it provides robust security, scalability, and fault tolerance for modern applications. This API is designed for developers and teams who prioritize secure data handling and seamless integration.

# Features

# üîí Advanced Encryption
- Implements AES-256-GCM, a widely trusted cryptographic algorithm ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
  
# ‚ö° High Performance
- Built on Actix Web, enabling high concurrency and minimal latency for enterprise-grade workloads.

# üöÄ Developer-Friendly
- Fully documented endpoints with Swagger UI for interactive exploration.
- Postman Collection for easy testing and debugging.

# ‚úÖ Error-Resilient
- Comprehensive input validation and detailed error handling, ensuring security and reliability.

# üõ†Ô∏è Configurable and Scalable
- Environment-driven configuration for seamless deployment across environments.
- Dockerized for rapid container-based deployment and scalability.

# Endpoints:
- Encrypt: POST /encrypt ‚Äì Send a message to receive encrypted text.
- Decrypt: POST /decrypt ‚Äì Send encrypted text to retrieve the original message.

# How It Works üëåüèº
 Encryption Logic 
- Converts plaintext into an encrypted Base64 string using AES-256-GCM.
- Ensures confidentiality and integrity through authenticated encryption.

 Decryption Logic
- Reverses the encryption process, validating the ciphertext and decrypting it back to plaintext.

 Error Handling
- Comprehensive error responses, including validation for key length, port configuration, and payload structure.

 Shared Cipher
- Optimized for performance by reusing a shared cipher instance, reducing overhead during heavy usage.

# Why Choose Secure Encryption API?
- Secure by Design: Adheres to cryptographic best practices.
- Production-Ready: Handles high-concurrency environments efficiently.
- Developer Focused: Easy to integrate, test, and deploy.
- Portable: Containerized for seamless deployment across any cloud provider or infrastructure.
